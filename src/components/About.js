            <p>Hello! I am Adam. One and half year ago  I
                started writing my first code in python and today after reading
                many books, documentation and written projects I would like
                to start my adventure as Junior Python Backend or Fullstack
                Developer. Privately, for 10 years I trained athletics. Sport has
                taught me to never give up and always strive for the goal.
            </p>
        </div>
